          In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
          prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
          documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
          Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and
          wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
          Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
          collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
          formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee
          listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
          encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]
